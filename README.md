# PyLife
A small life simulator game made in pure python,
users who have python3.4+ can run the source code, those who do not can use our pre-built packages to run it.

However we only support a range of Operating Systems:
- MacOS/Darwin (Excluding IOS) 10.X+
- Windows 10.X+
- Linux

please not that if you do run the source on other O.Sâ€™s we hold no responsibility and will not help you with any issues found or caused.

# Overview
The game should never be run in sudo/admin mode as no operations are made to any protected folders/files.

A internet connection is recommended so you can get the latest game data for a even cooler life in game !

The game does attempt to set console title, use colour on output and log everything
Logs can be found in the directory(/data/logs) created wherever the executable/source code is held.
All data created stored and downloaded are stored in (/data)

The game does use multi-threading for smoother experience this may cause a bit of lagg, soon a option will be available to disable multi-threading.

The game does not upload any data to our servers only analytics used to review our game,
this includes when you first installed the game and what version.
You may request to see a list of all details our servers hold by emailing me at gangnam253@gmail.com and you may also request for us to wipe your data.
